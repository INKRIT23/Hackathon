# Project Name
Care-cruiser: Care Cruiser is an integrated solution for patient care, assistance, and monitoring based on a comprehensive, multidisciplinary design approach. Care Cruiser seamlessly integrates into the healthcare system, providing a unique opportunity to enable more efficient service for caregivers, and more responsive environments for patients. Our proposed solutions consist of 2 parts: automated wheelchairs and a robotic assistant.
  
The speed regulation is one of the prime features of our wheelchair system. The system allows the user to control the mobility of the chair with less effort and more robustness and safety. The speed is regulated over an inclined plane and slows down when it identifies an obstacle.
 
The second part is a robotic assistant. The humanoid robot will serve humanity, especially the elderly, bedridden, and differently-abled in the most efficient and reliable way. It has an accurate reminder system that notifies the time of medicine consumption and supplies the same. Also, act as a caregiver by fulfilling their requirements e.g. bringing water. The instructions are given as voice commands which are further converted to text by the robot. This voice control allows the movement and action of patients. They help to reduce loneliness and help them with social and emotional needs which further allows the elderly and the disabled to have an independent life.
